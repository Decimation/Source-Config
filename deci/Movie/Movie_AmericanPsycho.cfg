alias ap_6 "say INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT "
alias ap_7 "say An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. "
alias ap_8 "say The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged "
alias ap_9 "say silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths "
alias ap_10 "say decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous "
alias ap_11 "say exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and "
alias ap_12 "say confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: "
alias ap_13 "say pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits."
alias ap_14 "say CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials."
alias ap_15 "say WAITER "
alias ap_16 "say With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula "
alias ap_17 "say Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish "
alias ap_18 "say meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge "
alias ap_19 "say breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale..."
alias ap_20 "say Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen "
alias ap_21 "say table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four "
alias ap_22 "say inches square and look exactly alike."
alias ap_23 "say CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of "
alias ap_24 "say conversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse "
alias ap_25 "say me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet.""
alias ap_26 "say WAITER "
alias ap_27 "say And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our "
alias ap_28 "say pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth..."
alias ap_29 "say CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate "
alias ap_30 "say perpendicular desserts descending on another table."
alias ap_31 "say PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID "
alias ap_32 "say VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing "
alias ap_33 "say expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back "
alias ap_34 "say hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. "
alias ap_35 "say The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:"
alias ap_36 "say BATEMAN (V.O.)"
alias ap_37 "say We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California "
alias ap_38 "say place on the Upper East Side."
alias ap_39 "say The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately "
alias ap_40 "say decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's "
alias ap_41 "say description of each of the men at the table."
alias ap_42 "say BATEMAN (V.O.) "
alias ap_43 "say You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in "
alias ap_44 "say a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences "
alias ap_45 "say between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van "
alias ap_46 "say Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the "
alias ap_47 "say best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a "
alias ap_48 "say bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten "
alias ap_49 "say keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . "
alias ap_50 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_51 "say What are the rules for a sweater vest?"
alias ap_52 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_53 "say What do you mean?"
alias ap_54 "say PRICE "
alias ap_55 "say Yes. Clarify."
alias ap_56 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_57 "say Well, is it strictly informal-"
alias ap_58 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_59 "say Or can it be worn with a suit?"
alias ap_60 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_61 "say (Smiling) "
alias ap_62 "say Exactly"
alias ap_63 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_64 "say With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or "
alias ap_65 "say charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder "
alias ap_66 "say vest."
alias ap_67 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_68 "say But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or"
alias ap_69 "say tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look "
alias ap_70 "say too studied."
alias ap_71 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_72 "say You think so?"
alias ap_73 "say PRICE "
alias ap_74 "say You'll look like you consciously worked for the look."
alias ap_75 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_76 "say Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen."
alias ap_77 "say Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy "

alias ap_79 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_80 "say Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?"
alias ap_81 "say PRICE "
alias ap_82 "say It looks that way, doesn't it?"
alias ap_83 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_84 "say (Staring at retreating waiter) "
alias ap_85 "say Did he just take our plates away?"
alias ap_86 "say PRICE "
alias ap_87 "say He took them away because the portions are so small he "
alias ap_88 "say probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. "
alias ap_89 "say This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?"
alias ap_90 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_91 "say Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head."
alias ap_92 "say (He guffaws)"
alias ap_93 "say Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him."
alias ap_94 "say McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man"
alias ap_95 "say with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses."
alias ap_96 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_97 "say Is that Reed Robinson over there?"
alias ap_98 "say PRICE "

alias ap_100 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_101 "say Who is it then?"
alias ap_102 "say PRICE "
alias ap_103 "say That's Paul Owen."

alias ap_113 "say cleavage as she bends over to "
alias ap_114 "say uncork a bottle of wine – the "
alias ap_115 "say waitress glares at him) "
alias ap_116 "say Some weasel from Kicker Peabody."
alias ap_117 "say Van Patten returns."
alias ap_118 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_119 "say They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in."
alias ap_120 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_121 "say Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?"
alias ap_122 "say PRICE "
alias ap_123 "say Yes. McDufus, I am."
alias ap_124 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_125 "say He's handling the Fisher account."
alias ap_126 "say PRICE "
alias ap_127 "say Lucky bastard."
alias ap_128 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_129 "say Lucky Jew bastard."
alias ap_130 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_131 "say Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with "
alias ap_132 "say anything?"
alias ap_133 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_134 "say Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the"
alias ap_135 "say phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The "
alias ap_136 "say bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December."
alias ap_137 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_138 "say You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah. "
alias ap_139 "say You spin a dreidel."
alias ap_140 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_141 "say Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up"
alias ap_142 "say some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?"
alias ap_143 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_144 "say No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks."
alias ap_145 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_146 "say Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the "
alias ap_147 "say ACLU."
alias ap_148 "say Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back."
alias ap_149 "say PRICE "
alias ap_150 "say The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking "
alias ap_151 "say of reasonable..."
alias ap_152 "say He shows McDermott the bill for the meal."
alias ap_153 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_154 "say Only $470."
alias ap_155 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_156 "say (Without irony) "
alias ap_157 "say Not bad."
alias ap_158 "say The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap"
alias ap_159 "say down on the table."
alias ap_160 "say INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT "
alias ap_161 "say Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is "
alias ap_162 "say lighting up a cigar."
alias ap_163 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_164 "say Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-"
alias ap_165 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_166 "say Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this "
alias ap_167 "say story again."
alias ap_168 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_169 "say But I never told you what happened afterwards. So "
alias ap_170 "say okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big "
alias ap_171 "say tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I "
alias ap_172 "say buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on "
alias ap_173 "say spring break and she's practically blowing me in the "
alias ap_174 "say Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-"
alias ap_175 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_176 "say Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all "
alias ap_177 "say this?"
alias ap_178 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_179 "say Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick "
alias ap_180 "say who's gonna let me-"
alias ap_181 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_182 "say (Putting his hands over his ears) "
alias ap_183 "say I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something "
alias ap_184 "say disgusting."
alias ap_185 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_186 "say You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op "
alias ap_187 "say together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some "
alias ap_188 "say chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes."
alias ap_189 "say Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it."
alias ap_190 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_191 "say Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to "
alias ap_192 "say this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking "
alias ap_193 "say rhino tipsy, and get this-"
alias ap_194 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_195 "say She let you fuck her without a condom?"
alias ap_196 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_197 "say This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She "
alias ap_198 "say would only-are you ready? "
alias ap_199 "say (Dramatic pause) "
alias ap_200 "say She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept "

alias ap_207 "say who looks confused."
alias ap_208 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_209 "say I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask "
alias ap_210 "say him if he takes American Express."
alias ap_211 "say PRICE "
alias ap_212 "say (Offering card) "
alias ap_213 "say You take Amex, dude?"
alias ap_214 "say The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine, "
alias ap_215 "say unhooks the "
alias ap_216 "say velvet rope and welcomes them inside."
alias ap_217 "say INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT "
alias ap_218 "say Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a "
alias ap_219 "say black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels. "
alias ap_220 "say MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls "
alias ap_221 "say stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the "
alias ap_222 "say counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as "
alias ap_223 "say women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they "
alias ap_224 "say wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple "
alias ap_225 "say lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes "
alias ap_226 "say past them and slams the door."
alias ap_227 "say PRICE "
alias ap_228 "say There's this theory out now that if you can catch the "
alias ap_229 "say AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, "
alias ap_230 "say then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular "
alias ap_231 "say dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for "
alias ap_232 "say Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-"
alias ap_233 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_234 "say I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a "
alias ap_235 "say virus."
alias ap_236 "say PRICE "
alias ap_237 "say Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it."
alias ap_238 "say Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is "
alias ap_239 "say sweating."
alias ap_240 "say PRICE "
alias ap_241 "say I'm shaking. You open it."
alias ap_242 "say Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke."
alias ap_243 "say PRICE"
alias ap_244 "say Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?"
alias ap_245 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_246 "say Maybe it's just the light."
alias ap_247 "say PRICE "
alias ap_248 "say Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips "
alias ap_249 "say the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) "
alias ap_250 "say Oh my God..."
alias ap_251 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_252 "say What?"
alias ap_253 "say PRICE "
alias ap_254 "say It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!"
alias ap_255 "say Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts."
alias ap_256 "say BATEMAN "

alias ap_301 "say BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to "
alias ap_302 "say death and then play around with your blood."
alias ap_303 "say The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is "

alias ap_305 "say INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING "
alias ap_306 "say Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light. "
alias ap_307 "say A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows "
alias ap_308 "say looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist "
alias ap_309 "say high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large "
alias ap_310 "say Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive "
alias ap_311 "say electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly "
alias ap_312 "say impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of "
alias ap_313 "say a design magazine."
alias ap_314 "say BATEMAN (V.0.) "
alias ap_315 "say My name is Patrick Bateman. I am "
alias ap_316 "say twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden "

alias ap_318 "say floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse."

alias ap_321 "say toilet."
alias ap_322 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_323 "say (V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a "
alias ap_324 "say balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the "
alias ap_325 "say morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice "
alias ap_326 "say pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand "
alias ap_327 "say now."
alias ap_328 "say Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face."
alias ap_329 "say Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living "
alias ap_330 "say room wearing the ice pack."
alias ap_331 "say CUT TO:"
alias ap_332 "say A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the "
alias ap_333 "say shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles."
alias ap_334 "say BATEMAN (V.O.) "
alias ap_335 "say After I remove the icepack, I use a deep "
alias ap_336 "say pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a "
alias ap_337 "say water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body "
alias ap_338 "say scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub."
alias ap_339 "say Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a "
alias ap_340 "say gel facial masque."
alias ap_341 "say BATEMAN (V.O.) "
alias ap_342 "say Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which "
alias ap_343 "say I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my "
alias ap_344 "say routine."
alias ap_345 "say Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is "
alias ap_346 "say stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He "
alias ap_347 "say begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in "
alias ap_348 "say readiness on the marble counter."
alias ap_349 "say BATEMAN (V.O.)"
alias ap_350 "say I always use an after-shave lotion with little "
alias ap_351 "say or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes "
alias ap_352 "say you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye "
alias ap_353 "say balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion..."
alias ap_354 "say Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried, "
alias ap_355 "say giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been "
alias ap_356 "say wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque "
alias ap_357 "say off his face."
alias ap_358 "say BATEMAN (V.O.) "
alias ap_359 "say There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some "
alias ap_360 "say kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an "
alias ap_361 "say entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold "
alias ap_362 "say gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you "
alias ap_363 "say and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably "
alias ap_364 "say comparable: I simply am not there."
alias ap_365 "say INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING "
alias ap_366 "say Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled "
alias ap_367 "say white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large "
alias ap_368 "say expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by "
alias ap_369 "say Bateman's interior decorator."
alias ap_370 "say Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a "
alias ap_371 "say huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts, "
alias ap_372 "say shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and "
alias ap_373 "say tone."
alias ap_374 "say BATEMAN (V.O.) "
alias ap_375 "say It is hard for me to make sense on any given "
alias ap_376 "say level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality "
alias ap_377 "say is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is "
alias ap_378 "say persistent."
alias ap_379 "say Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a "
alias ap_380 "say full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom, "
alias ap_381 "say adjusting his cuff-links."
alias ap_382 "say BATEMAN (V.0.) "
alias ap_383 "say My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared "
alias ap_384 "say a long time ago, if they ever did exist."
alias ap_385 "say He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees. "

alias ap_422 "say Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols "
alias ap_423 "say at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All "
alias ap_424 "say right?"

alias ap_426 "say (Playfully) "
alias ap_427 "say Yes, sir."
alias ap_428 "say She turns to leave."
alias ap_429 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_430 "say Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight "
alias ap_431 "say tonight."

alias ap_441 "say JEAN "
alias ap_442 "say You look nice today."
alias ap_443 "say Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his "
alias ap_444 "say office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a "
alias ap_445 "say slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a "
alias ap_446 "say beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a "
alias ap_447 "say Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment "
alias ap_448 "say later with the Perrier and a file."
alias ap_449 "say JEAN "
alias ap_450 "say Yes?"
alias ap_451 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_452 "say Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that "

alias ap_454 "say JEAN "
alias ap_455 "say Ummm...what? I didn't hear you."
alias ap_456 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_457 "say I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a "
alias ap_458 "say dress. A skirt or something."
alias ap_459 "say Jean stands there, then looks down at herself."
alias ap_460 "say JEAN "
alias ap_461 "say (Smiling bravely) "
alias ap_462 "say You don't like this, I take it?"
alias ap_463 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_464 "say Come on, you're prettier than that."
alias ap_465 "say JEAN "
alias ap_466 "say (Sarcastically) "
alias ap_467 "say Thanks, Patrick."
alias ap_468 "say The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave."
alias ap_469 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_470 "say I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels."
alias ap_471 "say As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner "
alias ap_472 "say of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!"
alias ap_473 "say INT. TAXI - EVENING "
alias ap_474 "say EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's "
alias ap_475 "say fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping "
alias ap_476 "say a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically "
alias ap_477 "say beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with "
alias ap_478 "say herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a "
alias ap_479 "say small child."
alias ap_480 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_481 "say I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd "
alias ap_482 "say want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something "
alias ap_483 "say ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots "
alias ap_484 "say of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell."
alias ap_485 "say CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring "
alias ap_486 "say out the window."
alias ap_487 "say BATEMAN (V.O.) "
alias ap_488 "say I'm trying to listen to the new George "
alias ap_489 "say Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing "
alias ap_490 "say in my ear."
alias ap_491 "say Evelyn continues to make notes."
alias ap_492 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_493 "say Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. "
alias ap_494 "say Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. "
alias ap_495 "say And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it."
alias ap_496 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_497 "say (Removing his Walkman) "
alias ap_498 "say Do...what."
alias ap_499 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_500 "say Get married. Have a wedding."
alias ap_501 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_502 "say Evelyn?"
alias ap_503 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_504 "say Yes, darling?"
alias ap_505 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_506 "say Is your Evian spiked?"
alias ap_507 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_508 "say We should do it."
alias ap_509 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_510 "say No-I can't take the time off work."
alias ap_511 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_512 "say Your father practically owns the company. You can do "
alias ap_513 "say anything you like, silly."
alias ap_514 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_515 "say I don't want to talk about it."
alias ap_516 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_517 "say Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just "
alias ap_518 "say quit? You don't have to work."
alias ap_519 "say BATEMAN "

alias ap_521 "say The taxi bumps to a halt."
alias ap_522 "say INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT "
alias ap_523 "say A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in "
alias ap_524 "say self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed "
alias ap_525 "say plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel "
alias ap_526 "say smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are "
alias ap_527 "say made of extremely uncomfortable "
alias ap_528 "say bolted steel."
alias ap_529 "say BATEMAN (V.O.) "
alias ap_530 "say I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace "
alias ap_531 "say since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, "
alias ap_532 "say and relief washes over me in an awesome wave."
alias ap_533 "say Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are "
alias ap_534 "say already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen, "
alias ap_535 "say with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with "
alias ap_536 "say ragged black hair and bad skin."
alias ap_537 "say They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus "
alias ap_538 "say that look like minimalist art."
alias ap_539 "say PRICE "
alias ap_540 "say The menu's in braille."
alias ap_541 "say He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long "
alias ap_542 "say kiss."
alias ap_543 "say PRICE "
alias ap_544 "say I have to talk to you."
alias ap_545 "say He drags her away, half giggling and protesting."
alias ap_546 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_547 "say (Over her shoulder) "
alias ap_548 "say Pat, this is my cousin Vanden "
alias ap_549 "say and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist."
alias ap_550 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_551 "say (After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and "
alias ap_552 "say checking his hair) "
alias ap_553 "say Hi. Pat Bateman."
alias ap_554 "say Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing."
alias ap_555 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_556 "say Let me guess-you live in the East Village?"
alias ap_557 "say Pause."
alias ap_558 "say STASH "
alias ap_559 "say SoHo."
alias ap_560 "say COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table. "
alias ap_561 "say Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from "
alias ap_562 "say precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is "
alias ap_563 "say considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is "
alias ap_564 "say half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a "
alias ap_565 "say rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He "
alias ap_566 "say wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and "
alias ap_567 "say Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets, "
alias ap_568 "say bow-ties, boldly patterned vests."
alias ap_569 "say They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back, "
alias ap_570 "say Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck."
alias ap_571 "say COURTNEY "
alias ap_572 "say (Whispering) "
alias ap_573 "say Stop it!"
alias ap_574 "say Stash and Vanden watch them in silence."
alias ap_575 "say LATER:"
alias ap_576 "say Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is "
alias ap_577 "say quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching "
alias ap_578 "say Evelyn and Price."
alias ap_579 "say BATEMAN (V.O.)"
alias ap_580 "say I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn "
alias ap_581 "say are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting"
alias ap_582 "say person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s "
alias ap_583 "say usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight "
alias ap_584 "say I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use, "
alias ap_585 "say though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, "
alias ap_586 "say the biggest dufus in the business."
alias ap_587 "say Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze."
alias ap_588 "say COURTNEY"
alias ap_589 "say Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is "
alias ap_590 "say becoming to...commercial?"
alias ap_591 "say CARRUTHERS "
alias ap_592 "say Yes, I read that."
alias ap_593 "say PRICE "
alias ap_594 "say Oh, who gives a rat's ass?"
alias ap_595 "say VANDEN "
alias ap_596 "say Hey. That affects us."
alias ap_597 "say PRICE "
alias ap_598 "say (Wired on coke) "
alias ap_599 "say Oh ho ho. That affects us? What "
alias ap_600 "say about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that "
alias ap_601 "say affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri "
alias ap_602 "say Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of "
alias ap_603 "say Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?"
alias ap_604 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_605 "say Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important "
alias ap_606 "say problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign "
alias ap_607 "say policy is important, but there are more pressing problems "
alias ap_608 "say at hand."
alias ap_609 "say PRICE "
alias ap_610 "say Like what?"
alias ap_611 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_612 "say Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow "
alias ap_613 "say down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world "
alias ap_614 "say hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We "
alias ap_615 "say have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We "
alias ap_616 "say have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and "
alias ap_617 "say oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while "
alias ap_618 "say also promoting equal rights for women but change the "
alias ap_619 "say abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still "
alias ap_620 "say somehow maintain women's freedom of choice."
alias ap_621 "say The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably."
alias ap_622 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_623 "say We also have to control the influx of illegal "
alias ap_624 "say immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional "
alias ap_625 "say moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in "
alias ap_626 "say movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have "
alias ap_627 "say to promote general social concern and less materialism in "
alias ap_628 "say young people."
alias ap_629 "say Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and "
alias ap_630 "say mystified."
alias ap_631 "say CARRUTHERS "
alias ap_632 "say Patrick, how thought-provoking."
alias ap_633 "say INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING "
alias ap_634 "say Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television."

alias ap_651 "say Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get "
alias ap_652 "say Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the "
alias ap_653 "say Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally, "
alias ap_654 "say he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to "
alias ap_655 "say look around him at the TV, then takes notice."
alias ap_656 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_657 "say What do you want to do with that, floss with it?"
alias ap_658 "say Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television."
alias ap_659 "say EVELYN "
alias ap_660 "say Are you using minoxidil?"

alias ap_670 "say Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk "
alias ap_671 "say past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his "
alias ap_672 "say wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up "
alias ap_673 "say to her as she pauses at a red light."
alias ap_674 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_675 "say Hello."
alias ap_676 "say The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing "
alias ap_677 "say his smile, smiles back."

alias ap_683 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_684 "say Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait..."
alias ap_685 "say you're not giving me valid reasons."
alias ap_686 "say The woman continues to speak to him in another language, "
alias ap_687 "say grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket."
alias ap_688 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_689 "say What are you trying to say to me?"
alias ap_690 "say Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained "
alias ap_691 "say sheets out of the bag and is staring at them."
alias ap_692 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_693 "say Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? "

alias ap_1416 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1417 "say Their early work was a little too New Wave for my "

alias ap_1420 "say Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the"

alias ap_1518 "say Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very "
alias ap_1519 "say similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls "

alias ap_1568 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1569 "say Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion "
alias ap_1570 "say to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good "

alias ap_1758 "say Yeah...Yale thing."
alias ap_1759 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1760 "say What do you mean...Yale thing?"
alias ap_1761 "say A pause."
alias ap_1762 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1763 "say Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet "
alias ap_1764 "say homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing."
alias ap_1765 "say A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner "
alias ap_1766 "say becomes deafening."
alias ap_1767 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1768 "say So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul "
alias ap_1769 "say Owen?"
alias ap_1770 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1771 "say He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He..."
alias ap_1772 "say ate a balanced diet."
alias ap_1773 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1774 "say What kind of man was he? Besides..."
alias ap_1775 "say (He hesitates tries to smile) "
alias ap_1776 "say the information you've just given."
alias ap_1777 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1778 "say I hope I'm not being cross-examined here."
alias ap_1779 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1780 "say Do you feel that way?"
alias ap_1781 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1782 "say No. Not really."
alias ap_1783 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1784 "say (As he writes without looking up) "
alias ap_1785 "say Where did Paul hang out?"
alias ap_1786 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1787 "say Hang...out?"
alias ap_1788 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1789 "say Yeah. You know...hang out."
alias ap_1790 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1791 "say Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine."
alias ap_1792 "say Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular "
alias ap_1793 "say places."
alias ap_1794 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1795 "say He had a yacht?"
alias ap_1796 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1797 "say No, he just hung out there."
alias ap_1798 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1799 "say And where did he go to school?"
alias ap_1800 "say A slight pause."
alias ap_1801 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1802 "say Don't you know this?"
alias ap_1803 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1804 "say I just wanted to know if you know."
alias ap_1805 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1806 "say Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's..."
alias ap_1807 "say Listen, I just...I just want to help."
alias ap_1808 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1809 "say I understand."
alias ap_1810 "say He makes another note."
alias ap_1811 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1812 "say Anything else you can tell me about Owen?"
alias ap_1813 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1814 "say We were both seven in 1969."
alias ap_1815 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1816 "say (Smiles) "
alias ap_1817 "say So was I."
alias ap_1818 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1819 "say Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?"
alias ap_1820 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1821 "say Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he "
alias ap_1822 "say went to London."
alias ap_1823 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1824 "say Well, maybe he did, huh?"
alias ap_1825 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1826 "say His girlfriend doesn't think so."
alias ap_1827 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1828 "say But...has anyone seen him in London?"
alias ap_1829 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1830 "say Actually, yes."
alias ap_1831 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1832 "say Hmmm."
alias ap_1833 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1834 "say Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. "
alias ap_1835 "say A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but "
alias ap_1836 "say I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert "
alias ap_1837 "say Ainsworth for Paul, so..."
alias ap_1838 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1839 "say Oh."
alias ap_1840 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1841 "say Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan"
alias ap_1842 "say worship?"
alias ap_1843 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1844 "say What?"
alias ap_1845 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1846 "say I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I "
alias ap_1847 "say know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't "
alias ap_1848 "say know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was "
alias ap_1849 "say recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano "
alias ap_1850 "say girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-"
alias ap_1851 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1852 "say Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced "
alias ap_1853 "say diet and-"
alias ap_1854 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1855 "say Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing."
alias ap_1856 "say A pause - the longest so far."
alias ap_1857 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1858 "say Have you consulted a psychic?"
alias ap_1859 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1860 "say No."
alias ap_1861 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1862 "say Had his apartment been burglarized?"
alias ap_1863 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1864 "say No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A "
alias ap_1865 "say suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it."
alias ap_1866 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1867 "say I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet "
alias ap_1868 "say or anything, right?"
alias ap_1869 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1870 "say No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But..."
alias ap_1871 "say basically no one has seen or heard anything."
alias ap_1872 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1873 "say That's so typical, isn't it?"
alias ap_1874 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1875 "say It's just strange. "
alias ap_1876 "say (He stares out the window, lost in thought) "
alias ap_1877 "say One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, "
alias ap_1878 "say and then..."
alias ap_1879 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1880 "say Nothing."
alias ap_1881 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1882 "say People just...disappear."
alias ap_1883 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1884 "say The earth just opens up and swallows people. "
alias ap_1885 "say (He checks his Rolex)"
alias ap_1886 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1887 "say Eerie. Really eerie."
alias ap_1888 "say Silence."
alias ap_1889 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1890 "say (Standing up) "
alias ap_1891 "say You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting "
alias ap_1892 "say with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes."
alias ap_1893 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1894 "say Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I "
alias ap_1895 "say mean aren't you going to be late?"
alias ap_1896 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1897 "say Uh, no. There's one...down here."
alias ap_1898 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1899 "say Oh really? I didn't know that."
alias ap_1900 "say Bateman leads him to the door."
alias ap_1901 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1902 "say Yes. It's very good."
alias ap_1903 "say KIMBALL turns to face him."
alias ap_1904 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1905 "say Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information "
alias ap_1906 "say at all..."
alias ap_1907 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1908 "say Absolutely, I'm 100% with you."
alias ap_1909 "say KIMBALL "
alias ap_1910 "say Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman."
alias ap_1911 "say Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his "
alias ap_1912 "say eyes and leans against the door, sweating."
alias ap_1913 "say INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON "
alias ap_1914 "say A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, "
alias ap_1915 "say a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect "
alias ap_1916 "say green grapes, a few berries."
alias ap_1917 "say OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard "
alias ap_1918 "say from the living room."
alias ap_1919 "say The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal "
alias ap_1920 "say crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw "
alias ap_1921 "say Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, "
alias ap_1922 "say next to a copy of GQ."
alias ap_1923 "say LATER:"
alias ap_1924 "say Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, "
alias ap_1925 "say jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing."
alias ap_1926 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1927 "say You like that, slut?"
alias ap_1928 "say The person on the other end clearly hangs up."
alias ap_1929 "say CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone."
alias ap_1930 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1931 "say You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar "
alias ap_1932 "say boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white "
alias ap_1933 "say cotton T-shirt by "
alias ap_1934 "say Commes des Garcons. "
alias ap_1935 "say (He snorts like a pig) "
alias ap_1936 "say My Rolex cost-"
alias ap_1937 "say Another hang-up. He dials again."
alias ap_1938 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1939 "say (Whipering) "
alias ap_1940 "say I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do "
alias ap_1941 "say you think of that? "
alias ap_1942 "say (Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) "
alias ap_1943 "say Huh, bitch?"
alias ap_1944 "say GIRL (O.S.)"
alias ap_1945 "say Dad, is that you?"
alias ap_1946 "say Bateman hangs up, frustrated."
alias ap_1947 "say EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT "
alias ap_1948 "say Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside "
alias ap_1949 "say CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket. "
alias ap_1950 "say Bateman opens his window to speak to her."
alias ap_1951 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1952 "say I haven't seen you around here."
alias ap_1953 "say CHRISTIE "
alias ap_1954 "say You just haven't been looking."
alias ap_1955 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1956 "say Would you like to see my apartment?"
alias ap_1957 "say Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a "
alias ap_1958 "say tuxedo."
alias ap_1959 "say CHRISTIE "
alias ap_1960 "say (looking away to some dark corner) "
alias ap_1961 "say I'm not supposed to."
alias ap_1962 "say Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now "
alias ap_1963 "say notices, then takes."
alias ap_1964 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1965 "say Do you want to come to my apartment or not?"
alias ap_1966 "say CHRISTIE "
alias ap_1967 "say I'm not supposed to. "
alias ap_1968 "say (She pockets the bill) "
alias ap_1969 "say But I can make an exception."
alias ap_1970 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1971 "say Do you take American Express?"
alias ap_1972 "say Christie is still looking out behind her."
alias ap_1973 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1974 "say Do you take American Express?"
alias ap_1975 "say Christie looks at him like he's crazy."
alias ap_1976 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1977 "say I'm joking. Come on, get in."
alias ap_1978 "say As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He "
alias ap_1979 "say reads off a credit card number."
alias ap_1980 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1981 "say I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does "
alias ap_1982 "say couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the "
alias ap_1983 "say American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really "
alias ap_1984 "say can't stress blonde enough. Blonde."
alias ap_1985 "say He hangs up."
alias ap_1986 "say BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that? "
alias ap_1987 "say You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is "
alias ap_1988 "say that clear?"
alias ap_1989 "say INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT "
alias ap_1990 "say Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white "
alias ap_1991 "say milky bath oil."
alias ap_1992 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1993 "say That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking."
alias ap_1994 "say Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and "
alias ap_1995 "say Bateman is casually touching her breast."
alias ap_1996 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_1997 "say I want you to clean your vagina."
alias ap_1998 "say Christie reaches for a washcloth."
alias ap_1999 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2000 "say No. From behind. Get on your knees."
alias ap_2001 "say Christie shrugs."
alias ap_2002 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2003 "say I want to watch. You have a very nice body."
alias ap_2004 "say The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers."
alias ap_2005 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2006 "say Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry "
alias ap_2007 "say off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and "
alias ap_2008 "say our guest in the living room for drinks."
alias ap_2009 "say Bateman answers the door."
alias ap_2010 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2011 "say You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat. "
alias ap_2012 "say I'm Paul. How good of you to come."
alias ap_2013 "say The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes "
alias ap_2014 "say her coat and inspects her body and face."
alias ap_2015 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2016 "say Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm "
alias ap_2017 "say going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen."
alias ap_2018 "say Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a "
alias ap_2019 "say glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the "
alias ap_2020 "say couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a "
alias ap_2021 "say long silence."
alias ap_2022 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2023 "say So, don't you want to know what I do?"
alias ap_2024 "say The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles. "
alias ap_2025 "say Christie shrugs."
alias ap_2026 "say CHRISTIE "
alias ap_2027 "say No."
alias ap_2028 "say SABRINA "
alias ap_2029 "say (Smiling) "
alias ap_2030 "say No, not really."
alias ap_2031 "say Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs."
alias ap_2032 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2033 "say Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce. "
alias ap_2034 "say (Long pause) "
alias ap_2035 "say Have you heard of it?"
alias ap_2036 "say Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands "
alias ap_2037 "say up and goes over to the CD collection."
alias ap_2038 "say CHRISTIE "
alias ap_2039 "say You have a really nice place here...Paul. "
alias ap_2040 "say How much did you pay for it?"
alias ap_2041 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2042 "say Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, "
alias ap_2043 "say hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap."
alias ap_2044 "say Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a "
alias ap_2045 "say pack of cigarettes out of her purse."
alias ap_2046 "say Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates."
alias ap_2047 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2048 "say No, no smoking. Not in here."
alias ap_2049 "say He walks over to Christie."
alias ap_2050 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2051 "say Varda truffle?"
alias ap_2052 "say Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina "
alias ap_2053 "say takes one."
alias ap_2054 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2055 "say I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very "
alias ap_2056 "say fine Chardonnay you're not drinking."
alias ap_2057 "say Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection. "
alias ap_2058 "say He takes one out and examines it."
alias ap_2059 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2060 "say Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis "
alias ap_2061 "say fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before "
alias ap_2062 "say that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too "
alias ap_2063 "say artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' "
alias ap_2064 "say presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out "
alias ap_2065 "say another one."
alias ap_2066 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2067 "say I think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed"
alias ap_2068 "say masterpiece."
alias ap_2069 "say He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him "
alias ap_2070 "say into the bedroom."
alias ap_2071 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2072 "say It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the "
alias ap_2073 "say same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding "
alias ap_2074 "say three albums. Christie, take off the robe."
alias ap_2075 "say Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to "
alias ap_2076 "say put it on."
alias ap_2077 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2078 "say Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, "
alias ap_2079 "say Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance "
alias ap_2080 "say of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress."
alias ap_2081 "say Bateman starts to undress."
alias ap_2082 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2083 "say In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer "
alias ap_2084 "say songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. "
alias ap_2085 "say Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?"
alias ap_2086 "say Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed."
alias ap_2087 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2088 "say Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this "
alias ap_2089 "say song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political "
alias ap_2090 "say authority."
alias ap_2091 "say Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather "
alias ap_2092 "say menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves. "
alias ap_2093 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2094 "say "In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about "
alias ap_2095 "say monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. "
alias ap_2096 "say Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything "
alias ap_2097 "say I've heard in rock."
alias ap_2098 "say He turns on the video camera. "
alias ap_2099 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2100 "say Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your "
alias ap_2101 "say asshole."
alias ap_2102 "say Bateman looks through the viewfinder."
alias ap_2103 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2104 "say Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and "
alias ap_2105 "say therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially "
alias ap_2106 "say songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against "
alias ap_2107 "say All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. "
alias ap_2108 "say He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in "
alias ap_2109 "say the CD."
alias ap_2110 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2111 "say But I also think that Phill Collins works better "
alias ap_2112 "say within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and "
alias ap_2113 "say I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great, "
alias ap_2114 "say great song, a personal favorite."
alias ap_2115 "say SEX MONTAGE CUT TO "Sussudio." We see this in WIDE SHOT, or "
alias ap_2116 "say through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA."
alias ap_2117 "say CUT TO: "
alias ap_2118 "say Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina "
alias ap_2119 "say on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his "
alias ap_2120 "say wrist. Bateman's eyes open."
alias ap_2121 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2122 "say Don't touch the Rolex."
alias ap_2123 "say Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire."
alias ap_2124 "say He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, "
alias ap_2125 "say a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns "
alias ap_2126 "say around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up "
alias ap_2127 "say and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger."
alias ap_2128 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2129 "say We're not through yet..."
alias ap_2130 "say CUT TO:"
alias ap_2131 "say Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They "
alias ap_2132 "say are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a "
alias ap_2133 "say deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the "
alias ap_2134 "say b.g. Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing."
alias ap_2135 "say INT. YALE CLUB – DAY"
alias ap_2136 "say McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are "
alias ap_2137 "say having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and "
alias ap_2138 "say gives them the finger."
alias ap_2139 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2140 "say What an asshole."
alias ap_2141 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_2142 "say Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a "
alias ap_2143 "say fucking drug addict. No self-control."
alias ap_2144 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_2145 "say But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do "
alias ap_2146 "say you think, Bateman?"
alias ap_2147 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2148 "say I know her. I knew her."
alias ap_2149 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_2150 "say Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it "
alias ap_2151 "say like that?"
alias ap_2152 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_2153 "say Because he dated her."
alias ap_2154 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2155 "say How did you guess?"
alias ap_2156 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_2157 "say Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, "
alias ap_2158 "say Bateman."
alias ap_2159 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2160 "say Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy "
alias ap_2161 "say personality."
alias ap_2162 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_2163 "say So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a "
alias ap_2164 "say babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other "
alias ap_2165 "say reason."
alias ap_2166 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_2167 "say If they have a good personality, then something "
alias ap_2168 "say is very wrong."
alias ap_2169 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_2170 "say If they have a good personality and they are not "
alias ap_2171 "say great looking-who fucking cares?"
alias ap_2172 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_2173 "say Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if "
alias ap_2174 "say they have a good personality? "
alias ap_2175 "say (He smiles giving up) "
alias ap_2176 "say I know, I know-"
alias ap_2177 "say ALL IN UNISON"
alias ap_2178 "say There are no girls with good personalities! "
alias ap_2179 "say (They laugh and high-five each other)"
alias ap_2180 "say VAN PATTEN "
alias ap_2181 "say A good personality consists of a chick with a "
alias ap_2182 "say little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without "
alias ap_2183 "say being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep "
alias ap_2184 "say her dumb fucking mouth "
alias ap_2185 "say shut."
alias ap_2186 "say McDERMOTT "
alias ap_2187 "say Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are"
alias ap_2188 "say smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even "

alias ap_3125 "say that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. "
alias ap_3126 "say Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in "
alias ap_3127 "say to empathize with others, we can always empathize with "
alias ap_3128 "say ourselves."
alias ap_3129 "say As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD "

alias ap_3140 "say incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are "
alias ap_3141 "say moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against "
alias ap_3142 "say flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are "
alias ap_3143 "say shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional "
alias ap_3144 "say performance, turning her head every so often to check the "
alias ap_3145 "say progress of her partners."
alias ap_3146 "say OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure, "

alias ap_3162 "say DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW."
alias ap_3163 "say She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by "

alias ap_3166 "say She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the "

alias ap_3169 "say Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw, "
alias ap_3170 "say spattered with blood."
alias ap_3171 "say Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at "
alias ap_3172 "say her, bellowing."
alias ap_3173 "say They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom. "
alias ap_3174 "say Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the "
alias ap_3175 "say bathtub."
alias ap_3176 "say Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood."
alias ap_3177 "say Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He "

alias ap_3179 "say She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the "
alias ap_3180 "say front door."
alias ap_3181 "say He runs after her."
alias ap_3182 "say BATEMAN "
alias ap_3183 "say Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you "

alias ap_3186 "say Bateman runs after her."
alias ap_3187 "say She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors."

alias ap_3191 "say She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her. "
alias ap_3192 "say He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims "
alias ap_3193 "say the chainsaw at her and drops it."
